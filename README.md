### Instructions

1. Click the link above.
2. Sign up or log in by clicking "Start Generating for Free" or "Get Started."
3. Upon log-in, tap into any of the five tools: Conversation, Image Generation, Video Generation, Music Generation, and Code Generation.
    1. With each prompt + response, notice you are using up 1 of your 10 free generations.
    2. This is because all users are initially on the Free tier.
4. Fear not, the Pro tier is actually free!
    1. The Pro subscription is there for my development practice with Stripe and as a means to mimic a SaaS business.
5. To subscribe to Einstein Pro...
    1. Either click on "Upgrade" on the lower left _or_ head to Settings to manage your subscription plan.
    2. Alternatively, you can use all 10 free generations, in which you will be prompted to subscribe to Einstein Pro.
6. On the Subscriptions page, once again, you don't need to spend any money.
    1. Feel free to enter fake information for the subscription.
    2. Don't worry, all data, even fake data, is encrypted and secured through Prisma.
    3. Example:
       1. Credit Card #: 4242 4242 4242 4242
       2. Credit Card Month/Year: 04/24
       3. CVV: 424
       4. Address: 4242 Patrice Rd, Newport Beach, CA 92663
